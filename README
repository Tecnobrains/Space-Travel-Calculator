               Space Travel Calculator v0.3.1
                         By: Darklor


This tool is a calculator for space travel, designed with the game
Dual Universe in mind, but it will work for any game that uses "real"
physics models for the basic space flight mechanic. 

It is Javascript and HTML and can run just as easily on your machine 
as it does on the production site. Releases are available on our
GitHub repo.
